.widths {
/*
    When using Flexbox, 2 widths are involved:
    - the flex container's width: $container-width
    - the sum of all the flex items width: $items-width

    With those 2 widths, we can end up in 3 different scenarios:

    $container-width is larger than $items-width
    $container-width is equal to $items-width
    $container-width is smaller than $items-width
    This means we can end up with:

    more space than needed: $remaining-space
    just enough space for all items to fit
    not enough space for all items: $shrinking-space


   flex-grow: 1;
   The value 1 is the growth factor of the flex item:
   it's the share of $remaining-space that will be attributed to this flex item.

   If we were to attribute the same growth factor to both flex items,
   the remaining space would be equally distributed to both:

   What would happen if both flex items had different growth factors?

   In that case, each of them would receive a share relative to their growth factors:
