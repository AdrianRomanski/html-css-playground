/*

The gap property can also accept 2 values:

the first value will act as the row gap
the second value will act as the column gap

If you only want to specify either a vertical gap or a horizontal one,
use the row-gap and column-gap properties respectively.

The main benefit of gap is that it only inserts between the flex items, and not around them.
