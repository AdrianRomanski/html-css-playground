The align-items
property allows you to define how you want to distribute the space between
and around flex items, along the cross axis.

You can choose one of the following keywords:

start the flex items will be packed towards the start of the cross axis (usually at the top)
end the flex items will be pushed to the end of the cross axis
center the flex items will be positioned towards the center of the cross axis
baseline the flex items baseline (which is the position of the bottom of each letter) will be positioned towards the center of the cross axis
stretch the flex items will increase their size to fill the whole length of the cross axis (usually the height)

stretch on flex-direction column may be extremely use full

The align-self
If you want to align one flex item differently than the others, you can use align-self.
It accepts the same values as align-items.
The difference is that it applies to a single flex item, rather than the parent flex container.

The align-content
property allows you to define how you want to distribute the space
between and around the lines of a flex container.

The values for align-content are similar to the ones used for justify-content,
but instead of spacing out flex items horizontally, it's spacing out lines vertically.

To summarize:

align-items determines how flex items are positioned on their line
align-content determines how flex lines are positioned within the flex container
