<!--The <abbr> HTML element represents an abbreviation or acronym.-->

<!--When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use,
 along with the <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation. This informs the user what the abbreviation or acronym means.-->

<!--  The optional title attribute can provide an expansion for the abbreviation or acronym when
a full expansion is not present. This provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content
while informing all users what the abbreviation means. If present, title must contain this full description and nothing else.-->


<!--Examples-->

<!--Marking up an abbreviation semantically
To mark up an abbreviation without providing an expansion or description, use <abbr> without any attributes,
 as seen in this example.-->

<p>Using <abbr>HTML</abbr> is fun and easy!</p>


<!--Providing an expansion
Adding a title attribute lets you provide an expansion or definition for the abbreviation or acronym.-->

<p>Ashok's joke made me <abbr title="Laugh Out Loud">LOL</abbr> big time.</p>

<!--<p>Ashok's joke made me <abbr title="Laugh Out Loud">LOL</abbr> big time.</p>-->

<!--Defining an abbreviation
You can use <abbr> in tandem with <dfn> to more formally define an abbreviation, as shown here.-->
<p>
    <dfn id="html"><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> </dfn> is a
    markup language used to create the semantics and structure of a web page.
</p>

<p>
    A <dfn id="spec">Specification</dfn> (<abbr>spec</abbr>) is a document that
    outlines in detail how a technology or API is intended to function and how it
    is accessed.
